# CustomerLogWithSQL
CustomerLog that also adds entries to a database 
Uses tkinter and sqlite3


Used for recording client phone numbers and description of the problems they are having, while also creating a database and table for the entries.
Entries can then be retrieved in full or dropped entirely for clearer recording
